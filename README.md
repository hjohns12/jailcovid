# Project Prospectus 

For this project, I will highlight the spread COVID-19 in jails and prisons, and immigrant detention facilities will be New York-focused. I will highlight the narrative of how COVID-10 spread rapidly due to the slow response of the DOC commissioner and other city officials. For comparison, I will compare the rate of COVID-19 spreading inside/outside of jails in other places. 

The narrative of this story points towards the underlying insight that jails are unsafe for people trapped in them and people outside of jails. I would like to test some of the statistical models developed by the University of Washington and University of Minnesota to show that because social distancing is nearly impossible inside of jails and prisons, decarceration is the only viable response.
